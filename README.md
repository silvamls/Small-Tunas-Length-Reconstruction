Small Tunas Length Reconstruction R Code Examples and Data for Small Tunas Length Reconstruction Approach


Here is all the spreadsheet data and R code needed to run the Small Tunas Length Reconstruction Approach (Silva et al., 2024). This is not a generic R code but a method applied to small tuna fisheries that can be replicated for other fisheries.

Description: Real-length catch compositions are the preferred choice for fisheries management when information on stock status and reference points is required. However, length data sets may be biased due to several factors, leading to unreliable fluctuations in mean lengths over time. As a result, length datasets may not accurately represent the true length composition of a population. To alleviate this issue, we developed a modeling approach that combines a reconstruction of the mean length trend over time, taking into account fluctuations stemming from gears, time, and space, with a random distribution simulation that recreates length frequencies to mimic the real length distributions.

More details about the conceptualization can be found in Silva et al., 2024.
